The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.

Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence'}, page_content='Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems.

The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.\\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat. In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems  reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors\\' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an \"AI winter\"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names.\\nIn the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications, amongst other use cases.\\nInvestment in AI boomed in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged, prompting debate about the future of AI and its impact on society.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence'}, page_content='the future of AI and its impact on society.'),\n",

Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures; see artificial life) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers. These factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence.\\nThe philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:\\n\\nCan a machine act intelligently? Can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking?\\nAre human intelligence and machine intelligence the same? Is the human brain essentially a computer?\\nCan a machine have a mind, mental states, and consciousness in the same sense that a human being can? Can it feel how things are? (i.e. does it have qualia?)\\nQuestions like these reflect the divergent interests of AI researchers, cognitive scientists and philosophers respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of \"intelligence\" and \"consciousness\" and exactly which \"machines\" are under discussion.\\nImportant propositions in the philosophy of AI include some of the following:\\n\\nTuring\\'s \"polite convention\": If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.\\nThe Dartmouth proposal: \"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\"\\nAllen Newell and Herbert A. Simon\\'s physical symbol system hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\\nJohn Searle\\'s strong AI hypothesis: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"\\nHobbes\\' mechanism: \"For \\'reason\\' ... is nothing but \\'reckoning,\\' that is adding and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the \\'marking\\' and \\'signifying\\' of our thoughts...\"', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence'}, page_content='The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:'),\n",
